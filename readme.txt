Automatically paginate posts by inserting the &lt;!--nextpage--&gt; Quicktag into WordPress posts, pages, or custom post type content.

== DESCRIPTION ==

Automatically paginate WordPress content by inserting the &lt;!--nextpage--&gt; Quicktag.

Option is provided to control what post types are automatically paginated (default is just `post`). Supports `post`, `page`, and any public custom post types.

Option is also provided to specify how many pages content should be broken out over, or how many words should be included per page.

== Installation ==

1. Upload automatically-paginate-posts to /wp-content/plugins/.
2. Activate plugin through the WordPress Plugins menu.
3. Configure plugin by going to Settings > Reading.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where do I set the plugin's options =
The plugin's options are added to the built-in **Reading** settings page in WordPress.

= Can I disable the plugin's functionality for specific posts, pages, or custom post type objects? =
Yes, the plugin adds a metabox to individual items in supported post types that allows the autopaging to be disabled on a per-post basis.

= How can I add support for my custom post type? =
Navigate to Settings > Reading in WP Admin to enable this plugin for your custom post type.

You can also use the filter `autopaging_post_types` to add support by appending your post type's name to the array.

* `autopaging_post_types` - modify the post types supported by this plugin. Will override the values set under Settings > Reading.
